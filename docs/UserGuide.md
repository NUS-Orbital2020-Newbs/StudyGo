Choose the option saying `Search for an already created one`, search for the public task by its name, and press `Done`. By doing so, you could know how many others have finished the linked task, and whether or not you finish the task will also be shown to others whose tasks are linked to this task

* If you cannot find the desirable task, you could create one so that others could link to the task you want to track with. Instead of choosing the `Search for an already created one` option, you should choose the `Make this task available to others for them to search` option and press `Done`

![Link Task](images/LinkTask.png)
